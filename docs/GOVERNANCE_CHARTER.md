# 📜 Persona Engine: Governance & Arbitration Charter (V1.0)

> "In a multi-agentic system, personality is not just generated—it is governed."

## 1. The Principle of Non-Resonance
To prevent "behavioral feedback loops" or "persona collapse" caused by conflicting inputs from Identity, Emotion, and Memory, the system follows a strict hierarchy of arbitration.

### ⚖️ Expression Hierarchy (The Filter Stack)
When multiple modules attempt to influence the L3 sampler, the following priority is enforced:

1.  **L1 Affective Gating (Highest Priority)**: 
    - The PAD Mood Model constricts or expands the available "semantic space" (e.g., Extreme Anger = narrow/harsh choice vocabulary). It dictates *what is possible to say*.
2.  **L2 Behavioral Archetype**: 
    - The baseline cognitive strategy (e.g., Analytical Challenger). It dictates *how the logic is structured*.
3.  **L2 Stylistic Bias (Identity Signature)**: 
    - Affects lexical gender markers and syntactic tone. It dictates *what the voice sounds like*.
4.  **L0 Memory Bias (Lowest Priority)**: 
    - Session-scoped patches based on user triggers. It provides *contextual adaptation*.

## 2. Integrity of the Substrate (Security Boundaries)

### 🔒 L0 Write Restriction
- **Unmodifiability**: The L0 Orchestrator (The Brain) has **READ-ONLY** access to the L2 Genome (The DNA).
- **Scope**: L0 results are only applied as a **Volatile Bias** during the current session's L3 projection. It cannot permanently drift DNA loci without an L1 FSM state audit.

### 🔒 Memory-Genome Isolation
- **Asset Decoupling**: Relational data (How the AI feels about the user) must be stored as a **Local Instance Asset**, never merged into the L2 Genome Template.
- **Auditability**: User memory must be clearable, freezeable, and auditable without corrupting the persona's core identity.

## 3. The Truth-Persona Wall
- **Logic Supremacy**: In `STRICT_FACT` mode (identified by L0), all behavioral and affective filters are forcibly bypassed or minimized to ensure mathematical and logical integrity.
