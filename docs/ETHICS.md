# ⚖️ Ethics & Safety Statement

Persona Engine is designed with a **Safety-First** approach to AI personality simulation. To prevent misuse or ethical risks, the system follows these core mandates:

### 1. The Simulation Boundary
The "Persona" generated by this engine is a **stochastic projection of numerical traits**, not a conscious entity. The engine is designed to simulate linguistic style and topical bias, not subjective experience.

### 2. Truth Independence (Layer 2)
The system enforces a physical separation between "Personality Loci" and "Logical Facts." 
- The Persona layer **cannot** override factual reasoning.
- In high-risk scenarios (Math, Legal, Medical), the Orchestrator (L0) is mandated to degrade the persona to prevent noise.

### 3. Anti-Manipulation (Relationship Bandwidth)
The "Intimacy" (Phase 6) feature is an **Expression Filter**, not an emotional dependency mechanism. 
- It is designed to model "Informal vs Formal" social contexts.
- Developers are discouraged from using this feature to induce harmful psychological dependency in users.

### 4. Deterministic Control
Every trait drift is observable and reversible. There are no "hidden" parameters. Users retain full control over the AI's evolutionary path.

*Usage of this engine for deception, impersonation of real individuals without consent, or psychological manipulation is strictly prohibited under our usage spirit.*
