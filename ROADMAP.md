# Persona Engine Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the Persona Engine, integrating the GECCE Kernel with the 4-layer architecture.

---

## Phase 0: Kernel Infrastructure (DONE)
- [x] EventBus integration for asynchronous communication.
- [x] Module Registry for hot-swappable layers.
- [x] Traceability and Event Logging.

## Phase 1: Genome & Modeling (DONE)
- [x] Define L2 Loci JSON Schema.
- [x] Implement "Truth Independence" validator.
- [x] Static Visualization Playground.

## Phase 2: Core FSM & Drift (DONE)
- [x] Deterministic State Machine (Forming -> Stable).
- [x] Feedback-driven Drift Controller.
- [x] Interaction counting and locking logic.

## Phase 3: Orchestration & Degradation (DONE)
- [x] Scenario analysis (Social vs. Strict Fact).
- [x] Influence level adjustment.
- [x] Kill-switch mechanism.

## Phase 4: Expression & Visualization (DONE)
- [x] Seeded stochastic sampling (L3).
- [x] **Prompt Augmenter**: Translating values to instructions.
- [x] **High-Tech Dashboard**: Real-time DNA & History visualization.

## Phase 5: Evaluation & Security (DONE)
- [x] Automated stress testing for "Persona Leakage".
- [x] Kernel Snapshot Manager for state capture.
- [x] Refined evaluation logic with negation detection.

## Phase 6: Salience & Evolution (DONE)
- [x] **Topic Attractors**: Bias conversation direction without altering core logic.
- [x] **Intimacy/Bandwidth Gating**: Depth control based on interaction count.
- [x] **Constrained Recombination**: L2 Genome mixing with safety anchors.

## Phase 7: Identity Substrate (DONE)
- [x] **Stylistic Bias**: Quantified gender and identity signatures.
- [x] **Governance Charter**: Formalizing the hierarchy of expression.
- [x] **DNA Re-ordering**: Priority-based trait organization.

## Phase 8: Affective Manifold (DONE)
- [x] **PAD Model**: Continuous 3D emotional substrate.
- [x] **Affective Warping**: Real-time modulation of behavior by current mood.
- [x] **Bio-Sensory UI**: Heartbeat ECG and Mood Map visualization in the dashboard.

## Phase 9: Fluid Stance & Archetypes (DONE)
- [x] **R.W.C Model**: 3D Stance Vector (Rigor, Warmth, Chaos).
- [x] **Stance Mapping**: Continuous DNA interpolation based on vectors.
- [x] **Intent Auto-Stance**: Scenario-aware posture adjustment.

## Phase 10: Multi-Session Coherence (DONE)
- [x] **Snapshot Persistence**: Saving affective state and drift to file (Regex-safe).
- [x] **Memory Salience Bridge**: Affect-biased RAG retrieval filters.
- [x] **Reflection Journal**: O(1) performance logging of internal evolution.

## Phase 11: Meta-Cognitive Self-Correction (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Offline Reflection**: AI analyzes its own journal to detect "Personality Decay."
- [ ] **Dynamic Mutation**: Adjusting DNA variability based on long-term feedback trends.
- [ ] **Charter Evolution**: Proposing updates to the Governance Charter.
